Cosmosoc challenge completed by-Dev, Manan, Maitreyee and Kaustubh

Challenges- 
1. To open and get info about Lightcurve_1.fits file (Done by- Kaustubh in Kaustubh_lightcurves.ipynb and Maitreyee in lightcurves_maitreyee.ipynb)
2. To plot scatterplot of PDCSAP_FLUX v/s TIME(Done by-Maitreyee in lightcurves_maitreyee.ipynb)
3. To plot scatterplot of PDCSAP_FLUX v/s TIME for which sap quality>0(Done by-Maitreyee in lightcurves_maitreyee.ipynb)
4. To read image data of fits file and also develop the image with different variations of coloue using cmap(Done by- Kaustubh in Kaustubh_lightcurves.ipynb)

 There was also a bouns_image_1.fits file which was dealt by Dev and Manan
 Plot of graph of different columns present(ie- XI v/s ETA, XI_CORR v/s ETA_CORR and all other combinations)- Done by Dev in dev_bonus.ipynb
 Plot of image and also diplay of array of bonus image- Done by Manan in manan_bonusImg.ipynb

The given project gave us the opportunity to explore a whole new side of coding. Uptil now we really didnt get the opportunity to use coding in any usable way. But after this project we understand the power of python in coding industry. We also delve deep into matplotlib and astropy packages of pyhton. We got to experiment with different data and explore data science through this project. Overall it was a fun and indulging project that gave us the opportunity to learn a lot of new concepts(also how to use chatgpt effeciently LOL)
